# Show Me the Data Structures

This project is my submission for the data structures module in the Data Structures and Algorithms Udacity Nanodegree

## Problem 1: LRU Cache
Design a data structure known as a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. An LRU cache is a type of cache in which we remove the least recently used entry when the cache memory reaches its limit. For the current problem, consider both get and set operations as an use operation.

Your job is to use an appropriate data structure(s) to implement the cache.

In case of a cache hit, your get() operation should return the appropriate value.
In case of a cache miss, your get() should return -1.
While putting an element in the cache, your put() / set() operation must insert the element. If the cache is full, you must write code that removes the least recently used entry first and then insert the element.
All operations must take O(1) time.

For the current problem, you can consider the size of cache = 5.

## Problem 2: File Recursion
Write code for finding all files under a directory (and all directories beneath it) that end with ".c"

## Problem 3: Huffman Coding
Implement the Huffman coding algorithm.
